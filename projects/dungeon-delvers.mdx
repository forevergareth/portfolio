## Overview

Dungeon Delvers is a third-person dungeon crawler in a high-risk-high-reward dungeon environment where the player is a wizard who must survive the dungeon and kill monsters to loot item upgrades with a unique progression system.

The player will go through the dungeons upgrading killing the enemies/boss and acquiring loot to increase their progression. Upon killing the boss the player can go back to the hub and save their gear and progress or continue further to risk it all.

## Project Design Goals

### Dungeon System
The dungeon will be randomly chosen for the player and the player will have to fight the boss to either leave the dungeon or keep progressing to the next dungeon. 

### Skill System
The player has 3 key skills that fall within the three categories, offensive, defensive, and movement.  As the player progresses through the dungeon, they earn points that can be used to increase an attribute to any skill. 

### Loot System
The player will get loot through interactable items or through killing enemies/bosses, through the use of a loot table.

## Constraints
- One Month Timeframe

## Gameplay

### Core Loop

1.	**Tutorial Level** – The first level is designed to operate like a consistent introductory level. The player progresses through the dungeon rooms while defeating monsters with the goal of finding the boss room. As the player explored the dungeon they may come across interactable rewards that give the player upgrades.
2.	**Character Hideout Screen** – On the character screen the player will review their skills any available upgrades before starting a run into the dungeon.
3.	**Enter The Dungeon** – The player enters the dungeon and is dropped into a random dungeon we have made for them to explore. 
4.	**Boss Room** – The player encounters the boss and should defeat the boss which will spawn two portals, one portal will save the players progress and another takes the player to randomly selected level.
5.	**Dynamic Room** – The player chooses to risk going deeper into the dungeon/labyrinth, selecting the advance portal moves the player to another randomly selected level with scaled difficulty.
6.	**Save and Return** – The player chooses not to risk any more progress, selecting the return portal saves the players progress and takes them to the hideout screen allowing them to review their achievements.

### Shield

Max is able to jump with the player presses the SPACEBAR. While in the middle of a jump,
Max will jump further with a Double Jump when the player presses the SPACEBAR again.
Jumping and Double Jumping are used to reach new areas in the level, dodge enemy gunfire,
and adds a light 3D platforming element to the game.
